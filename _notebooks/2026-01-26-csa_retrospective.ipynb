    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This retrospective documents my contributions to the reQUESTers project, a gamified learning platform designed to track student progress through quests and award certificates based on completion milestones. My primary focus was on **designing the backend architecture**, building out the **comprehensive data flow** for how the system would operate, and **coordinating team efforts** to keep development organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Contributions\n",
    "- Comprehensive backend flow architecture and UML documentation\n",
    "- Backend development (in progress, collaborating with Trevor)\n",
    "- Certificate system planning and tier design\n",
    "- Team coordination and self-grading framework"

    "## 1. Certificate System Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The platform needed a way to reward students for completing quests, but there was no system in place for tracking milestones or awarding certificates. Key challenges included:\n",
    "- No defined structure for what certificate tiers would look like\n",
    "- No backend schema or flow for how progress would map to certificate eligibility\n",
    "- No clear plan for how the frontend and backend would communicate around certificates\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tier Design\n",
    "\n",
    "I planned a multi-tier certificate system to give students meaningful progression milestones:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Comprehensive Backend Flow Design\n",
    "\n",
    "A major part of my contribution was designing the full backend data flow for the project. I created detailed documentation ([Issue #16](https://github.com/Tvick22/reQUESTers/issues/16)) mapping out how every component would interact — from user actions to database updates to notifications. This gave the team a clear blueprint to build from.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layered Architecture Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The system follows a clean **Controller → Service → Repository** pattern that I documented for the team:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Controller Layer:** Handles HTTP requests (`QuestController`)\n",
    "2. **Service Layer:** Business logic for progress tracking and notifications\n",
    "3. **Repository Layer:** Database interactions for Users, Quests, and Progress\n",
    "4. **Event Publisher:** Async notification handling\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture document served as the foundation for how Trevor and I began building the backend together."

    "1. **Backend Architecture Design:** Learned to design scalable, layered systems following industry patterns (Controller → Service → Repository)\n",
    "2. **UML & System Modeling:** Built detailed class diagrams and flow charts to document how data moves through the system\n",

    "4. **Collaborative Development:** Worked closely with Trevor on backend development, learning how to divide responsibilities and stay aligned\n",
    "\n",
    "### Soft Skills Developed\n",
    "1. **Project Management:** Created tracking systems for team accountability through the self-grading framework\n",
    "2. **Technical Communication:** Documented complex system architecture clearly enough for the whole team to follow\n",
    "3. **Problem Decomposition:** Broke down the full certificate pipeline into discrete, buildable components\n",

    "### What Went Well\n",
    "- Thorough architectural planning gave the team a clear direction\n",
    "- Comprehensive data flow documentation provides a strong blueprint for implementation\n",
    "- Good team coordination through issue tracking and the self-grading framework\n",
    "- Collaborative partnership with Trevor keeps backend development moving\n",

    "- Backend implementation needs to progress further — architecture is strong but code is still early\n",
    "- Need to prioritize translating diagrams into working endpoints\n",
