    "This retrospective documents my contributions to the reQUESTers project, a gamified learning platform designed to track student progress through quests and award certificates based on completion milestones. My primary focus was on building a **secure and scalable certificate system** with backend integration and frontend user experience.\n",

    "### Key Contributions\n",
    "- Certificate authentication and access control system\n",
    "- Backend data flow architecture and UML documentation\n",
    "- Progress validation mechanisms\n",
    "- Dashboard visibility features and frontend integration\n",
    "- Team coordination and self-grading framework"

    "## 1. Certificate System Development\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The existing system had several critical issues:\n",
    "- Certificates were claimable without identity verification or task completion\n",
    "- Manual tracking led to errors and inconsistencies\n",
    "- No database schema existed for tracking tiers or progress\n",
    "- Endpoints lacked proper user progress validation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "I designed and implemented a multi-tier certificate system with the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Tier | Requirement | Badge |\n",
    "|------|-------------|-------|\n",
    "| Bronze | 50% completion | Basic achievement |\n",
    "| Silver | 75% completion | Intermediate achievement |\n",
    "| Gold/Mastery | 100% completion | Full mastery |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "async function awardCertificate(userId, progressData) {\n",
    "    // Fetch user progress from database\n",
    "    const userProgress = await fetchUserProgress(userId);\n",
    "    \n",
    "    // Determine tier eligibility based on completion percentage\n",
    "    const tier = determineTier(userProgress.completionPercentage);\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if (tier) {\n",
    "        // Store certificate in database\n",
    "        await storeCertificate(userId, tier, new Date());\n",
    "        \n",
    "        // Send notification to user\n",
    "        await notifyUser(userId, `Congratulations! You earned a ${tier} certificate!`);\n",
